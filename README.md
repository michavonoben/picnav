## Picture Navigator
##### Micha Gerwig 2015

Picture Navigator is a Navigation tool to browse very large picture collections using semantic and visual similarities of the pictures.  
The WebApp was developed as part of my Bachelor-Thesis in cooperation with the Pixolution GmbH Berlin.
The database where pictures are requested from is property of Pixolution: http://pixolution.de

To run Picture Navigator locally, navigate to the root directory of the project, where you see the gruntfile. Then run
```
grunt serve
```

and find the WebApp in your browser http://localhost:9000/ If you don't have grunt run 
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Or see http://gruntjs.com/getting-started for more information.
